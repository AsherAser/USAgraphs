Thank you for checkout out the Readme! 
I am Asher Smale, and I am making this out of frustration. These are embarassing stats that I am frequently mad at. 
I wanted to make that anger accessible and well sourced for people to see. If you would like to help, please do!

USAGraphs.com is a dark-themed, mobile-friendly, one-page static site built with Chart.js to highlight how the United States compares to developed and developing nations across key issues like healthcare, transportation, housing, and incarceration.


### Purpose
Progressives (and anyone else tired of empty culture war noise) can use this site to shift attention to real, structural issues backed by data â€” where America consistently underperforms.

### Tech Stack
- HTML/CSS/JS
- Chart.js for visualizations
- Manual dataset uploads (no APIs, I am still a begginer)
- Static hosting

### Layout
- All charts embedded on a single scrollable page
- Organized by collapsible categories (Healthcare, Housing, etc.)
- Minimal commentary, just the raw visual story

### How to Contribute
This is a static, manually-managed project by [Asher Smale](https://asherforcongress.com), but if you're interested in helping with datasets or visual polish, feel free to message!
